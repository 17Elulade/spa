Stock price analyser
This program allows you to view the trajectory of the returns of your chosen stock over the past 5 years.
This was an independent self tasked summer project that I took upon myself to do and completed towards the end of summer, 
to futher devlop my coding abilities and intrest in quantitative processes.


Things I have learnt during this programming task,
- Research and learning helps, copying does not
- Taking multiple dedicated sessions can avoid burnout instead of one big session
- Everything can be optimised and done better
  Thank you for listening and viewing my code, this will not be the last.
